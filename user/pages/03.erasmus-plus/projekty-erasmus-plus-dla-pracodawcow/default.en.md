We are an international organization that deals with implementing Erasmus+ program. As part of our activities, we host students and teachers from various EU countries, providing them with professional development through the organization of apprenticeships, courses, training, and job shadowing.

See what your company will gain if you accept a student for apprenticeship:

* an intern who will do the work for you and you will be able to focus on more important matters concerning your company
* students are fully insured (OC, KL, accident at work)
* the Erasmus+ project covers all costs related to the student's stay in the hosting country (accommodation, meals, local transfers, pocket money) – there are no costs incurred for you 
* You and your employees have a chance for interpersonal development and getting to know other cultures through cooperation with interns from EU countries
* Your company has a chance for development and international cooperation
* we will be in constant contact with you
* we post all our activities on FB – which is a visibility and marketing for our cooperation and your company
* we will take care of the full documentation; you will be asked to leave feedback after the end of the internship and to sign a few Erasmus+ school documents
